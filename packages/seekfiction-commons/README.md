# seekfiction-commons
 
This is a public package to develop [seekfiction](https://github.com/sasigume/seekfiction) more efficiently.

## Purpose of this package

In seekfiction, every anime data on Firestore are synced with Algolia so that users can search and update index.

This package defines common types for both Algolia and clients.

## Sorry

I'm new to GitHub packages and Node.js development.

This is public package but contents subject to change.
